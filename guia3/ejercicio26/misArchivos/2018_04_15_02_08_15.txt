Special Materials

Orichalcum Equipment
Orichalcum, sometimes referred to as phantom metal, weapons and armor forged from orichalcum have a translucent, mint-green appearance. Because of it's inherent properties, only certain weapons and armor can be made using the metal.

Orichalcum Weapon
A weapon made of orichalcum must be a melee weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage. Such a weapon is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming the damage resistance and immunities of creatures with an Etherealness feature, and can strike creatures that are hidden on the Ethereal Plane as if they were on the Material Plane.

Orichalcum Armor
Armor made of orichalcum must be armor significantly composed of metal. While wearing armor composed of Orichalcum, creatures with the Etherealness feature have disadvantage when attacking you.

Mithral Weapons and Ammunition
A weapon made of mithral weighs half as much as a normal weapon of it's kind. Mithral weapons gain the light property if they do not have the heavy property. Arrows or bolts crafted out of mithral increase the short range of bows and crossbows by 60 and 30 respectively.

Coin of Good Fortunes
Wonderous item (coin), Rare

Once used, this coin weathers away instantly, becoming worthless.

Twin Coins of Kelemvor
Wonderous item, rare
These ancient copper coins are always found in pairs; if they are seperated, they seem to find their way back to one another.

Kelemvor's Coin of Rebirth
Wonderous item (coin), Very Rare (requires attunement)
This strange gold coin seems to depict a riverside boat with a cloaked humanoid on one side, and on the other, the symbol of Kelemvor, god of death. This coin has no function until the attuned creature dies: after 24 hours, they are brought back as with the resurrection spell, and magically teleported to the nearest civilization's graveyard, usually in a recently excavated grave or open coffin. The coin is then consumed, dissapearing into Kelemvor's coffers. If the item is removed from the dead creature before this occurs, the coin is not consumed.

Coin of Tyr
Wondrous item (coin), rare
This silver coin has the emblem of Tyr, god of justice, on both sides. As an action, you can throw the coin into the air, where it dissapears; in it's place two knights will appear.

The rod stops moving only if it collides with an object that weighs 5000 pounds or more, at which it is pinned into the object and can be removed by pressing the button on it again. If it collides with an immovable rod, or an object being held in place by an immovable rod, both rods are instantly destroyed and a gate to the Astral Plane is opened. The gate originates at the point of the unstoppable rod's impact. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

No object with any dimension exceeding 6 inches can be placed in a pocket. You can place or remove an item from a pocket as though interacting with an object, but only a person wearing the belt can access the hidden pockets. As long as the item would fit in the extradimensional space, it can be easily placed or removed in a pocket, regardless of the size of the pocket's opening.
Placing a belt of hidden pouches inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

On impact, each creature within 10 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. The point it hit sheds bright light that extends 150 feet from the point, and dim light out a further 150 feet. This light fades after 1 minute. Magical darkness created by any spell of 3rd level or lower is immediately dispelled by this light. The light is sunlight.
- Grasping Formula. As an action, you produce a vial filled with squirming black maggots and throw it at a point within 30 feet of you.

Wondrous item, unknown rarity

You can use an action to play them, creating a horrid droning sound to which demons are immune.
